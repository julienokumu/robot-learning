trained my first PPO policy on google colab and loaded it locally for rendering on MuJoCo

went well for a start, my UR5e robot end-effector reached it's target every now and then

will tune my PPO policy to get better result, i need my robot to be able to this as easy as ABC

here's a clip of when it did reach it's target(feels like magic...look at my baby go!):
